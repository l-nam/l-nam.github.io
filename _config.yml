  Hi, my name's Lauren and I'm an aspiring change leader interested in product management, ui/ux research, and human capital strategy. I believe that <mark>people</mark> are at the core of every decision we make. I love finding ways to bridge the <mark>social sciences</mark> with financial analysis to account for the "people part" of strategy as a core facet in decision-making rather than an afterthought.

          Supported a state agency with large scale ERP overhaul and implementation
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            I supported my team in assisting our client, a large state agency, in the business process optimization needed to support modernization of their ERP system including implementation of a novel system. Utilizing <mark>process mapping</mark> I analyzed over 15 legacy and current state processes to expose areas of incompatibility and improvement before future state implementation. In addition I created a standardized process-step template in <mark>MS Visio</mark> and normalized all additional maps developed by my team before being finalized for the client.

            I collaborated with a team of four other Teaching Assistants to develop supplemental course content for <mark>over 130</mark> MBA and BBA students taking Negotiations at Emory University's Goizueta Business School. Student assignments were evaluated for knowledge gaps and individualized, actionable steps were given as feedback for improved course concept comprehension and retention. In addition I designed and led study/review sessions for all students throughout the semester.

          Increased vaccine access through human-centered problem solving.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Myself and a team of BBA and MSBA students analyzed and modeled various social drivers of vaccine hesitency amongst Emory University's employee population. Once key drivers were identified, our analysis was used in conjunction with social science theory to develop a COVID-19 education and vaccination campaign targeting employees of Emory University.
